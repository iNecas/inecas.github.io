      <description>One of the most painful things after going Spacemacs full-time has been the unexpected behavior of Magit buffers in combination with evil bindings. Especially h and l not doing what I would expect.  After sitting in my TODO list for a while, I&amp;#39;ve finally got to finding a solution for this. Luckily evil-magit is supporting it natively, so it&amp;#39;s as simple as adding this to your .spacemacs.el. (setq evil-magit-want-horizontal-movement t)  Just note, that you need to do so before loading the evil-magit mode that is providing this capability.</description>
