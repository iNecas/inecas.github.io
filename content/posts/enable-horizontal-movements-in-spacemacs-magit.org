One of the most painful things after going Spacemacs full-time has been the
unexpected behavior of Magit buffers in combination with evil bindings.
Especially =h= and =l= not doing what I would expect.

After sitting in my TODO list for a while, I've finally got to finding a
solution for this. Luckily [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-magit][evil-magit]] is supporting it natively, so it's as
simple as adding this to your =.spacemacs.el=.

#+begin_src emacs
(setq evil-magit-want-horizontal-movement t)
#+end_src

Just note, that you need to do so /before/ loading the =evil-magit= mode that is
providing this capability. Therefore, /don't use/ =with-eval-after-load= as I was
when trying this for the first time.

In you would like to leave some comments, please do so [[https://github.com/iNecas/inecas.github.io/pull/1][here]].
